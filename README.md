# Ping-Pong-Catcher
Demo to show Brush-type DC Motor Driver, DC/DC Converters
Based on the Japanese Pachinko game, the idea is a Ping-Pong Ball is dropped (or launched) at the top of the board.  It works it's way down the board in a random fashion.  The user is able to control position of the "Catcher" by pressing a Joystick right or left.  An optical detector (Laser and photocell) are used to monitor the "Catcher" and determine if the ball has been caught.  After being caught, the "Catcher" bucket will move to the right edge where a Servomotor will be activated to dump the ball out.
